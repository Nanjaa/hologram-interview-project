# Stephanie Forcier - Hologram Coding Interview

## Overview
This project is part of the technical coding portion of Hologram's interview cycle. The full set of instructions can be found here: https://www.notion.so/teamhologram/Full-Stack-Engineering-Exercise-24833577b6b680a38760ddc5729b5cff
Here is a TLDR of this project:

In this project, I will create an application that should accept a CDR (call detail record) file with usage strings. 
The app will parse the strings properly and save the data to a database.
This project also consists of a user-facing application where users can:
Upload a CDR file
Display the parsed and normalized records in a table

This project must also be containerized, with details for how to start and use it.

## Technologies
This project uses the following technologies:
- Flask (Python) - backend
- Vue (JavaScript) - frontend

TODO:
- Get Vue all set up
- Create a view that will allow users to upload a file
- Parse the file into usable data and save that data
- Create a view that will display the data
- Set up the project to be containerized and easily started
- Write tests!
